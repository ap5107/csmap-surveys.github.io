Delete data from yesterday
Delete Collected Data - delete your individual data by clicking either the “by Date” or the “by Time” button in the “Delete browse history” section.

In both “by Date” and “by Time”, you should select which time zone you were in on the date of access. The default time zone is (UTC-04:00) Eastern Time (US and Canada). 

By clicking on the “by Date” button, you can select a date from the past 7 days (including today). All stored data on the day will be deleted from the database. 


Selectable dates are dynamically restricted to the past 7 days. The user can search for available time zones using keywords. A confirmation window will pop up in the end to prevent user errors.

Please delete the day’s worth of data from yesterday. 

Add a webpage to the blacklisted sites.

Set a “Blacklist” - you create a list of web domains by entering websites in the “Blacklist a website” section. Pages from these domains will not be sent to our database.




The user can remove a blacklisted website by clicking on the red x next to the website’s URL address.

Please add “www.cnn.com” to the blacklisted sites.

Visit this web page: https://www.cnn.com/travel/destinations/colorado.

After this, you can remove the extension from the browser by right-clicking the icon and clicking “Remove from Chrome”.

URL Historian is a Chrome extension that enables the collection of web browsing activities or website content in real-time. It collects browsing data for research purposes from research participants who opt-in to share their browsing history and page content when browsing Twitter, Facebook and Youtube. Page content information is collected if the research participant opt-in and the data collected is only for the social media site(s) opted for. 

The extension provides visualization feature that beautifully displays the participant's locally stored browsing history. The visual displays reflects browsing habits such as frequency of visits and word searches on search engines, visits times in a heatmap graph, and visit details in a tabulated format. Importantly, the visualization information presented remains in the user's local machine and is composed of the entirety browsing history. Therefore, websites visit before and during extension installation is used to generate the visualizations. Of the entire browsing history displayed, the extension only collects information the participant has opted to be collected.

Collected data is securely stored in Amazon Web Services(AWS) and only accessible to the CSMaP research team. The extension is available in the Chrome Web Store and accessible via invitation only.
