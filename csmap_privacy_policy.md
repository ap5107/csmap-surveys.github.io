You have been invited to take part in a research study to help researchers understand social media and politics.

This study will be conducted by Joshua Tucker, FAS – Politics, Arts & Science, New York University; Jonathan Nagler, FAS – Politics, Arts & Science, New York University; and Richard Bonneau, FAS – Biology, Computer Science, Arts & Science, New York University. If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to install a Chrome plugin that allows us to collect data about your web browsing activity, specific to the survey you are participating in. We only collect data that you consent to be collected in the survey you are participating in.

There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand social media and politics. You will be compensated the amount promised for a completed survey.

The confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. Raw survey data will be held on an encrypted hard drive, separate from all other datasets. These hard drives will be stored in locked cabinets. Once anonymized, survey data will be stored on secure NYU servers. 

Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty. For interviews, questionnaires, or surveys, you have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer. Information not containing identifiers may be used in future research, shared with other researchers, or placed in a data repository without your additional consent.
