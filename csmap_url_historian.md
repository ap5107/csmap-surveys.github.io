## Introduction {#intro}

#### URL Historian is a Chrome extension developed by New York University’s <a href="https://csmapnyu.org/">Center for Social Media and Politics (CSMaP)</a> This extension allows participants to share data that contributes to better understanding of how our ever-shifting online environment impacts politics and democracy.

When the URL Historian plug-in is activated and registered, it automatically begins collecting URLs visited. Participants can pause this collection at any time through the extension interface. Participants can also block specific domains from being collected through a blacklist feature provided in the extension. Participants can also opt-in to sharing data from popular social media websites. Data will only be collected from the social media web sites that the participant has opted-in to sharing. Configuration instructions are explained in detail below.

	
Data collected through URL Historian is anonymized and used for academic purposes only. All collected data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and only accessible by CSMaP researchers.
