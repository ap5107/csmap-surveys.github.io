<h1>CSMaP URL Historian</h1>
<p>
Thank you for downloading CSMaP URL Historian. URL Historian is a Chrome extension that collects browsing data from research participants who agree to share their browsing history and page content when browsing Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. All collected data is securely stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and only accessible by CSMaP researchers. </p>

<p>The extension provides a visualization feature that beautifully displays the participant’s browsing history. The visualizations reflect browsing habits such as frequency of website visits, term searches on search engines, visit times in a heatmap, and visit details in a tab format. All visualization information remains on the user’s local machine. Websites visited prior and during extension installation are used to generate the visualizations, but the extension only collects information the participant has opted to collect.</p>

<p>Participation in web browsing collection is completely voluntary. Participants may blacklist any websites they do not wish to have collected. Participants can delete data for up to 10 days within URL Historian, and can delete older data by contacting NYU CSMaP Engineers. Page content information is only collected if a participant opts-in and they may specify which social media sites they wish to share page content from. See the FAQ below for further information about using URL Historian.</p>

<p><strong>Please be aware that URL Historian collects the web browsing data of anyone using Google Chrome on the computer that URL Historian is installed on. If you share this computer with anyone, you should inform them that URL Historian is installed, and show them how they can pause the app and/or delete their browsing history when they use the computer.</strong></p>

<p>URL Historian is a non-profit open-source project developed to provide social and political science researchers information that contributes to better understanding the social and political impact of the web. For any questions on using the extension, requesting data deletion or other technical problems, please reach out to nyu-smapp-engineers@nyu.edu.</p>
