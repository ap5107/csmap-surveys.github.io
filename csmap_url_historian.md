# URL Historian

## Introduction

#### URL Historian is a Chrome extension developed by New York Universityâ€™s <a href="https://csmapnyu.org/">Center for Social Media and Politics (CSMaP)</a>. URL Historian allows participants to share data that contributes to better understanding of how our ever-shifting online environment impacts politics and democracy.

When the URL Historian plug-in is activated and registered, it automatically begins collecting URLs visited. Participants can pause this collection at any time through the extension interface. Participants can also block specific domains from being collected through a blacklist feature provided in the extension. Participants can also opt-in to sharing data from popular social media websites. Data will only be collected from the social media web sites that the participant has opted-in to sharing. Configuration instructions are explained in detail below.

	
Data collected through URL Historian is anonymized and used for academic purposes only. All collected data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and only accessible by CSMaP researchers.

## Configuring the plug-in
	
### Web browsing history

When the plug-in is registered and activated, it automatically begins collecting URLs visited. You can pause and resume data collection at any time through options on the extension interface. You can also block specific domains from being collected by adding the URLs of these domains to a blacklist feature within the extension.

### Social Media Data

You can also opt-in to sharing data from popular social media websites. To contribute this data, you can toggle the following options: 
	
* the Twitter option will collect tweet data when you visit twitter.com,
* the YouTube option will collect videos listed when visiting youtube.com,
* the Facebook option will solely collect URLs that appear on your Facebook pages when visiting facebook.com.

This data is only collected if a you opt-in to add these sites. Each social media site is activated separately. Data will only be collected from the social media websites that you have opted-in to sharing.

### Controlling what you share

<p>You can pause data collection using the pause toggle feature on the extension. This will pause all data collection until you toggle the pause control back to active.</p>
