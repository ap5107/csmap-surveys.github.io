<p>After you install the extension, you can access the URL Historian window by selecting the extension from the Chrome extension menu which can be accessed next to the address bar (puzzle piece icon).</p>
<ol>	
	<li>On the extension window, you will see a field to enter your User ID.</li>
<li>After entering your User ID, you will see a pop-up screen prompting you to enter your Survey ID.</li>
<li>After entering your Survey ID, the setup is complete. The extension will begin collecting your web history automatically.</li>
	</ol>
<p>The extension allows three registration attempts. After three failed registration attempts, the extension will uninstall automatically.</p>
